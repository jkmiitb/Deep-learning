# Deep dive into CNN

This project involves understanding the fundamental concepts & different algorithms to analyze the different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks. And implementation of these architectures in Python.
1 Basics of Deep Learning
This included learning the basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. By completing the two Coursera courses Neural Network and Deep Learning and Improving the Neural Network
2 Pytorch
After getting the some basic understanding of neural networks, now for implementing the neural nets Python has many libaries like Keras, Pytorch, etc.
In this project we learned the Pytorch library for implementing the neural networks.
3 CNN & It's Architectures
Then started learning the fundamental concepts of CNN .
After that implementing the CNN from scratch using Pytorch on a kaggle challenge Digit Recognizer
Reading the research papers of different architectures of CNN - AlexNet, VggNet, ResNet, GoogleNet
4 Implementing CNN Architecture & Transfer Learning
Implementing the AlexNet architecture from scratch on the dataset Fashion MNIST
Implementing and understanding the concept of Transfer Learning
Implementing the transfer Learning on different architectures - alexnet, vggNet, resNet, googleNet
